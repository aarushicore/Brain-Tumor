# Brain Tumor Detection using MobileNetV2 (Flask Web App)

This is a sub-project of the [Multi Disease Prediction](https://github.com/deoprakash/multi_disease_prediction) system. It provides a simple web interface to detect brain tumors using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 deep learning model.

## 🧠 Overview

This web app allows users to upload MRI brain images and predicts whether the image indicates:

- Glioma Tumor
- Meningioma Tumor
- Pituitary Tumor
- No Tumor

The model is built using **MobileNetV2** and wrapped in a **Flask** web application.
